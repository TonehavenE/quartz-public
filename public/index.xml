    <guid>https://eben.tonehaven.org/Concepts/Science/Physics/Fluid-Dynamics/Ideal-Gas</guid>
    <description>Ideal Gas Topic: Fluids Ideal Gas An ideal gas is a gas which obeys the Ideal Gas Law. Specifically, it is a gas which we make certain assumptions about so that we can more accurately and reliably model it using kinetic theory.</description>

    <title>Pascals Principle</title>
    <link>https://eben.tonehaven.org/Concepts/Science/Physics/Fluid-Dynamics/Pascals-Principle</link>
    <guid>https://eben.tonehaven.org/Concepts/Science/Physics/Fluid-Dynamics/Pascals-Principle</guid>
    <description>Topic: Fluids Pascal’s Principle What is Pascal’s Principle? :?: The principle that the pressure throughout a fluid is equal. Formally, Pascal’s Principle might be defined as: A pressure change at any point in a confined and in-compressible fluid is transmitted throughout the fluid such that the same change occurs everywhere.</description>

    <guid>https://eben.tonehaven.org/Concepts/Science/Physics/Fluid-Dynamics/Pressure</guid>
    <description>Topic: Fluids Pressure \text{Pressure} = P = \frac{F}{A} Measured in Pascals: 1 Pa = 1 N / m^2. Also measured in kilopascals kPa, atmospheres 1 atm = 101.3 kPa, and pounds per square inch, 1 atm = 14.7 psi.</description>
