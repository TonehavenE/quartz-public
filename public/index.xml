    <guid>https://eben.tonehaven.org/Concepts/Science/Physics/Fluid-Dynamics/Bernoulli's-Principle</guid>
    <description>Topic: Fluids Bernoulli’s Principle Fluid velocity and pressure are inverse. Therefore if a liquid is moving faster, it exhibits less pressure on the walls of the pipe.</description>

    <title>Hydrostatic Pressure</title>
    <link>https://eben.tonehaven.org/Concepts/Science/Physics/Fluid-Dynamics/Hydrostatic-Pressure</link>
    <guid>https://eben.tonehaven.org/Concepts/Science/Physics/Fluid-Dynamics/Hydrostatic-Pressure</guid>
    <description>Topic: Fluids Hydrostatic Pressure Hydrostatic pressure is the pressure in a fluid at rest. What does hydrostatic mean? :?: Fluid at rest. Hydrostatic Equation P = P_{0} + \rho gh \text{Pressure = External Pressure + density * gravity * height or depth} Note that this is Absolute Pressure, not Gauge Pressure.</description>

    <title>Pascals Principle</title>
    <link>https://eben.tonehaven.org/Concepts/Science/Physics/Fluid-Dynamics/Pascals-Principle</link>
    <guid>https://eben.tonehaven.org/Concepts/Science/Physics/Fluid-Dynamics/Pascals-Principle</guid>
    <description>Topic: Fluids Pascal’s Principle What is Pascal’s Principle? :?: The principle that the pressure throughout a fluid is equal. Formally, Pascal’s Principle might be defined as: A pressure change at any point in a confined and in-compressible fluid is transmitted throughout the fluid such that the same change occurs everywhere.</description>
