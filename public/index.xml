    <title>Pascals Principle</title>
    <link>https://eben.tonehaven.org/Concepts/Science/Physics/Fluid-Dynamics/Pascals-Principle</link>
    <guid>https://eben.tonehaven.org/Concepts/Science/Physics/Fluid-Dynamics/Pascals-Principle</guid>
    <description>Topic: Fluids Pascal’s Principle What is Pascal’s Principle? :?: The principle that the pressure throughout a fluid is equal. Formally, Pascal’s Principle might be defined as: A pressure change at any point in a confined and in-compressible fluid is transmitted throughout the fluid such that the same change occurs everywhere.</description>

    <guid>https://eben.tonehaven.org/Concepts/Science/Physics/Fluid-Dynamics/Pressure</guid>
    <description>Topic: Fluids Pressure \text{Pressure} = P = \frac{F}{A} Measured in Pascals: 1 Pa = 1 N / m^2. Also measured in kilopascals kPa, atmospheres 1 atm = 101.3 kPa, and pounds per square inch, 1 atm = 14.7 psi.</description>

    <guid>https://eben.tonehaven.org/Concepts/Science/Physics/Fluid-Dynamics/Van-der-Waals-Equation-of-State</guid>
    <description>Topic: Fluids Van der Waals Equation of State The Ideal Gas Law is just that; ideal. It turns out that gases don’t behave exactly like this, especially as your approach high pressures.</description>

    <title>Hydraulics</title>
    <link>https://eben.tonehaven.org/Concepts/Science/Physics/Fluid-Dynamics/Hydraulics</link>
    <guid>https://eben.tonehaven.org/Concepts/Science/Physics/Fluid-Dynamics/Hydraulics</guid>
    <description>Topic: Fluids Hydraulics Hydraulics rely on Pascals Principle to give mechanical advantage in some way. For example, you might lift a car using a hydraulic lift that functions by putting some force on one piston with a small area that lifts a much larger piston by a smaller amount.</description>

    <guid>https://eben.tonehaven.org/Concepts/Science/Physics/Fluid-Dynamics/Vapor</guid>
    <description>Topic: Fluids Vapor A vapor is very similar to a gas. However, the difference is that a substance below its Critical Temperature in the gaseous state is called a vapor; above the critical temperature it is called a gas.</description>
