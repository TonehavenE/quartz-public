Specifically, it is a gas which we make certain assumptions about so that we can more accurately and reliably model it using kinetic theory. The assumptions are:\n\nThere are a large number of molecules, N, each of mass m, moving in random directions with a variety of speeds\nThe molecules are, on average, separated by an amount much greater than the diameter of each molecule\nMolecules obey the laws of classical mechanics, and interact only in collisions; attractive forces are negligible\nCollisions are assumed to be perfectly elastic and of very short duration\n\nUnder these assumptions, we can do some pretty interesting physics to derive a relationship between the kinetic energy and the temperature of a gas.\nConsider a container with a side of area A. It is filled with a gas of N molecules, each mass m. Consider a single molecule of that gas, with an initial velocity \\vec{v} = v_{x}. It collides with the wall, creating a perfectly elastic collision and bouncing back with a velocity of - v_{x}. The wall therefore must exert a force of F = \\frac{dP}{dt} = \\frac{2mv_{x}}{dt} on the molecule. The molecule bounces back, hits the other wall, and then returns travelling a total distance of 2 \\ell over a time v_{x}\\Delta t \\to \\Delta t = \\frac{2\\ell}{v_{x}}. Finally, we can state that the force due to one molecule is\nF = \\frac{dp}{dt} = \\frac{\\Delta (mv)}{\\Delta t} = \\frac{2mv_{x}}{\\frac{2\\ell}{v_{x}}} = \\frac{mv_{x}^{2}}{\\ell}\nNow, let us extend to all molecules.\nF = \\frac{m}{\\ell} (v_{x1}^{2} + v_{x2}^{2} + \\dots + v_{xN}^{2})\nLet \\bar{v} be the average velocity.\n\\bar{v_{x}^{2}} = \\frac{v_{x1}^{2} + v_{x2}^{2} + \\dots + v_{xN}^{2}}{N}\nWe said that the average velocity is in a random direction, so \\bar{v_{x}} = \\bar{v_{y}} = \\bar{v_{z}}. By Pythagoras, we can say that \\bar{v^{2}} = \\bar{v_{x}^{2}} + \\bar{v_{y}^{2}} + \\bar{v_{z}^{2}}. Therefore, \\bar{v^{2}} = 3\\bar{v_{x}^{2}}.\nF = \\frac{m}{\\ell}N\\bar{v_{x}^{2}} = \\frac{m}{\\ell} N \\frac{\\bar{v^{2}}}{3}\nThe pressure on the wall is then P = \\frac{F}{A} = \\frac{1}{3} \\frac{Nm\\bar{v^{2}}}{A\\ell} = \\frac{1}{3} \\frac{Nm\\bar{v^{2}}}{V} \\to PV = \\frac{Nm\\bar{v^{2}}}{3} = \\frac{2}{3} N\\left( \\frac{1}{2} m\\bar{v^{2}}\\right)\nFrom the Ideal Gas Law, we know that PV = NkT, so\n\\frac{2}{3}\\left( \\frac{1}{2} m\\bar{v^{2}}\\right) = kT\nThe kinetic energy is therefore \\frac{3}{2} kT, and thus the average kinetic energy of molecules in an ideal gas is proportional to the absolute temperature of the gas.\nTo determine the average speed of molecules in a gas, use the equation\nv_\\text{root-mean-square} = \\sqrt{\\bar{v^{2}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{3kT}{m}}\n\nReferences\nPhysics for Scientists &amp; Engineers with Modern Physics; 18"},"Concepts/Science/Physics/Fluid-Dynamics/Navier-Stokes-Equations":{"title":"Navier-Stokes Equations","links":["Fluid-Dynamics","Concepts/Math/Differential-Equations/Partial-Differential-Equations","Concepts/Science/Physics/Fluid-Dynamics/Fluids","Concepts/Science/Physics/Newtonian-Mechanics/Velocity","Concepts/Science/Physics/Materials/Density","Concepts/Science/Physics/Fluid-Dynamics/Pressure","Viscosity","Concepts/Science/Physics/Newtonian-Mechanics/Force","Concepts/Math/Calculus/Derivatives/Multivariable/Divergence-Operator","Concepts/Science/Chemistry/Law-of-Conservation-of-Matter","Concepts/Math/Calculus/Derivatives/Multivariable/Partial-Derivatives","Concepts/Math/Calculus/Derivatives/Multivariable/Gradient-Vector","Laplace-Operator"],"tags":["science/physics/fluids"],"content":"Topic: Fluid Dynamics\nNavier-Stokes Equations\nThe Navier-Stokes Equations are a series of Partial Differential Equations that describe the motion of Fluids.\nThey can be presented in many forms.\nIncompressible, Newtonian Fluids\nLet \\vec{\\textbf{u}} denote Velocity, \\rho denote fluid Density, p denote Pressure, \\mu denote Viscosity, and \\vec{\\textbf{F}} denote any external Force.\nThe Divergence Operator of the velocity is 0 (essentially, Law of Conservation of Matter):\n\\nabla \\cdot \\vec{\\textbf{u}} = 0\nThe acceleration is dependent on internal forces and external forces:\n\\rho \\frac{\\partial \\vec{\\textbf{u}}}{\\partial t} = - \\nabla p + \\mu \\nabla^{2} \\vec{\\textbf{u}} + \\rho \\vec{\\textbf{F}}\n(note the Partial Derivatives, Gradient, and Laplace Operator).\nWe can develop some basic intuition for each of these terms.

The Van der Waals Equation of State is a way of accounting for the inaccuracies.\nThe two Ideal Gas assumptions that the Van der Waals equation accounts for are the effects of attractive forces between molecules and the finite volume of the molecules of a gas.\nIf we assume that the molecules of a gas are spherical with radius r and behave like hard spheres, the smallest distance possible is between two is 2r. Thus the actual volume cannot be 0. Let b represent the unavailable volume per mole of gas. Then we have\nP(V - nb) = nRT\nNext, we consider the intermolecular attraction between molecules.
