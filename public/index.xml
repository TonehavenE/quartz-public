    <description>Soldering Soldering is the process of connecting a component to a PCB by melting solder between the surfaces. Traditionally, soldering is done using a soldering iron - essentially a very hot stick of metal that you gently touch to heat the circuit board, solder, and component together.</description>

    <description>Ergonomic Keyboards An ergonomic keyboard is a tool for inputting symbols to a computer in a way that doesn’t compromise on the user’s comfort. Typical features that might make a keyboard more ergonomic that the traditional counterpart are a split design, ortholinear or columnar staggered keys, or non-traditional angles.</description>

    <guid>https://eben.tonehaven.org/Concepts/Science/Physics/Quantum-Mechanics/Planck-Constant</guid>
    <description>Planck’s Constant Planck’s constant, denoted by h, is a fundamental physical constant. A photon has energy equal to its Frequency multiplied by h. In SI Units, it has the exact value h = 6.62607015 \times 10^{-34} \text{ J}\cdot \text{Hz}^{-1}.</description>

    <guid>https://eben.tonehaven.org/Concepts/Science/Physics/Optics/Index-of-Refraction</guid>
    <description>Index of Refraction A medium is a material through which light or some other wave passes. Different transparent mediums have different optical densities, based on the speed of light in the material.</description>

    <guid>https://eben.tonehaven.org/Concepts/Science/Physics/Newtonian-Mechanics/Velocity</guid>
    <description>Velocity Velocity is a vector that denotes how fast and in what direction something is moving. Mathematically, it is written as \vec{v} = \vec{x}/t where \vec{x} represents the displacement.</description>
