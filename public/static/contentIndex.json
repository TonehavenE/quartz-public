I started toying with the idea of having a pointing device (something to move the mouse) integrated into the keyboard. In researching that idea, I stumbled upon an amazing design. Here are some of the key features:\n\nSplit Keyboard, 5x6 layout for 62 keys\nPMW3360 Motion Sensor Integrated under the right thumb for Trackball\nI^2C Communciation Between the Halves over RJ9\nArduino Micro on the Right, Pro Micro on the Left\nFully programmable with 32kB of flash\n\nI was enthralled, but the only way to make one was with a 3D Printer. So I purchased a 3D Printer over the holidays, and got to work setting it up. After honing in the printer, I fired it up to create the case. But that was just the beginning of the work. The shape is molded to the human hand to minimize movement and maximize comfort, which requires a 3D “keywell,” curving the keys to the fingers. This shape prevents standard printed circuit boards, which are rigid and planar.\nSo, QQurn’s design resorts to “handwiring,” where the switches are connected by dozens of individual short wires soldered in air. To make matters worse, switch matrices require a diode on each key (see here for why). You have to solder each wire in air, totaling over 200 connections. It is very tedious.\nSo, painfully, over about 20 hours, I wired all the switches, along with an I^2C bus to communicate between the two microcontrollers, and the trackball sensor. A few hours of troubleshooting and a lot of firmware tweaking later, and I have an absolutely amazing keyboard. You really can’t understand how comfortable it is until you use it for a full work day, but it was definitely worth the time, money, and effort. Now for the fun part: Photos!\n\n\nWhat Did I Learn?\nWhile I didn’t create this design myself, there was still a lot of work involved in manufacturing and wiring it. I learned a ton about 3D printing, soldering, and also the QMK firmware framework which enables the keyboard to work."},"Blog-Posts/Keyboards/ErgoTravel":{"title":"ErgoTravel","links":["Research/Ergonomic-Mechanical-Keyboards/Ergonomic-Keyboards"],"tags":["keyboards"],"content":"\nThe ErgoTravel was my first foray into the world of Ergonomic Keyboards. For this first build, I stuck with something tried and true. I purchased a kit from an online retailer, and built it according to the instructions. While the components were all included, I had to solder everything by hand, my first major experience with soldering. It was a lot of fun.\nOnce I had everything soldered and assembled, the next step was firmware. The keyboard runs QMK, a C-based firmware framework that runs on hundreds of keyboard designs, including the ErgoTravel. The main config, describing the electrical design, was already complete, but I had to create and tweak my own keymap. The keymap determines what pressing a given key actually does. I decided to get ambitious and try out as many of QMKs features as possible, including tap dances, layers, layer-taps, and leader key. It was great to explore the firmware and learn a bit of C.\nOnce I had built the keyboard and been using it for a few weeks, a small problem became apparent: the kit didn’t come with a full case, so the PCB was partially exposed. I was slowly noticing dust and gunk accumulating, which I thought could become an issue long term. So I wanted to create a more full enclosure. Luckily, my father is a hobbyist wood-worker, so we worked together create a case of walnut. It’s beautiful, I think."},"Blog-Posts/Keyboards/Icarus":{"title":"Icarus","links":["Concepts/Programming/Programming-Languages/CPP/QMK"],"tags":["keyboards"],"content":"Icarus\nIntroduction\nI had just finished a written math assignment when I thought to myself: why should I have to compute something on my calculator, then enter it into the computer? Why isn’t the calculator directly connected to my computer? So I decided to try and solve that problem by making a numpad and calculator in one. You activate calculate mode, input your calculation, and it writes out the answer. Here’s a quick feature overview:\n\nFully Programmable with QMK firmware\nCustom PCB with onboard Cortex M4 Microprocessor\nIntegrated 128x32 OLED\nUSB-C Connection\n4x5 Mechanical Key Matrix for 20 Keys\n\nThe project has two main parts: Hardware (PCB and case) and software (actual functionality).\nHardware Development\nCircuitry\nThe microprocessor (i.e. the brain) is integrated directly into a custom PCB, along with USB circuitry, the key matrix, and a voltage regulator. The MCU runs on an external 16MHz crystal. I designed the PCB using KiCad, a free and open source CAD suite for electrical engineering. PCB development is one of my favorite parts of these keyboard projects, because its the right mix of creativity, problem solving, and research. For this board in particular I spent a lot of time reading about the STM32F4xx series and the best design practices for PCBs. Here’s the final schematic:\n\nAnd the PCB Layout:\n\nI had the PCB manufactured and some of the surface mount soldering done by JLCPCB.\nCase Design\nOnce I had a designed the PCB, I needed somewhere to put it. A few months prior I had purchased a 3D printer, so I decided to design and 3D print a case. I created the enclosure in AutoDesk Fusion 360. I tried my hand at creating a screw-less design. The stackup involves three parts:\n\nThe main plate\nThe PCB\nThe bottom plate\n\nThe PCB is attached to the main plate by the tension between the mechanical switches (which snap into the plate) and the holes in the PCB. The bottom plate then has a “snap-fit” to attach to the main plate, fulling enclosing the PCB. Overall, I think it was pretty successful.\nSoftware Development\nThis ended up being where the bulk of my time on this project went. It turns out that programming a calculator isn’t as easy as I thought! It turned out to be a great learning experience. At the start of this project I didn’t really have much experience with C programming, but I developed a lot of skills by programming Icarus. The base for the firmware is the wonderful Quantum Mechanical Keyboard Firmware, or QMK. It has a lot of abstraction that makes it easy to get started with your own firmware. Each keyboard has a config that defines its electrical configuration and layout, and then each user can create their own keymaps, with a specific layout to fit them. I assumed that setting up the initial config would be the easy part (as it had been with my previous boards), but I was quickly proved wrong. The first time I plugged in the PCB and flashed it with firmware that I thought was correct, the entire thing hung and became non-responsive. I spent hours debugging before eventually discovering that the quartz clock that I had chosen for the microcontroller was not the same speed as the QMK default. Once I fixed that, it was on to programming the calculator functionality.\nWhile most normal inputs are easy to setup in QMK, I had to program the calculator functionality mostly from scratch. The way I tackled this was to create a togglable layer with custom defined keycodes corresponding to each matrix position. In other words, I defined functions for each key. Most of these functions write to a char array representing the current equation. The ”=” button then calls a function from the TinyExpr library to interpret that buffer into a numeric result, if possible. Pressing enter then sends it to the computer using the qmk “send_string()” function.\nTo make this all more user-friendly, I added a little 128x32 OLED that displays the current expression buffer and expected result as you enter in characters. On the default layer, where you just enter numbers like a numpad, it displays the layout because my keycaps are blank.\nFinal Product\n"},"Blog-Posts/Keyboards/Silvis":{"title":"Silvis","links":["Blog-Posts/Keyboards/Tantalus","keyboards/r_track","keyboards/icarus"],"tags":["keyboards"],"content":"\nIntroduction\nAfter building Tantalus and another Dactyl Manuform 5x6, I still wasn’t fully satisfied with my secondary keyboard. My Dactyl Manuform R-Track is perfect for my primary setup, but I have been moving around more and doing school work on a laptop. Unfortunately the Dactyl is quite bulky and a little finicky (owing to my amateur soldering job), so it isn’t very mobile.\nI began toying around with ideas for a while. I finally settled on creating another flat keyboard. There would be no mousing device, no curved keywells. I wanted to prioritize the typing experience, above other luxuries. I figure it is better to make the best portable keyboard possible than a mediocre mouse and mediocre keyboard. So from that came Silvis.\nFeature List\n\nCustom PCB with On-board STM32F411 microcontroller\n3D Printed Case designed in Fusion 360\nProgrammable with QMK\nAddressable Per-Key RGB\nUSB-C\nHotswappable Cherry MX keys\n\nHardware Development\nPCB\nI designed the Silvis PCB using the KiCad suite, which I’m now pretty adept with. The PCB features an STM32F411 microcontroller, which has 512 Kb of flash and 128 Kb of ram, plenty for a keyboard. The schematic is overall similar to one of my previous projects, Icarus, because I chose the same MCU for both. The biggest difference is that Silvis features per-key SK6812 Mini-E LEDs, which are reversed mounted. This means that you solder them on the back, but they point up through a hole illuminating the keys from below.\nLaying out the components for this PCB proved far more challenging then any of my previous designs. I wanted the design to be symmetric but unibody, with a couple of different angles between columns to match the splay of my hand. Additionally, each and every one of the 58 keys has both an LED and a diode (see here for why) attached to it. Placing that all by hand was… daunting. I knew I would make a mistake. So I started looking into ways to do it programmatically instead.\nErgoGen\nErgogen, short for ergonomic keyboard generator, is a Javascript project that allows you to describe a 2D keyboard layout using a YAML config, and then generate design files, including plate SVGs, PCBs, and even cases, from there. This allows for a much faster workflow, by tweaking code instead of manually shifting keys in KiCad. I used ErgoGen to place the switches, diodes, and LEDs for the Silvis matrix. I’m a huge fan of this project, and strongly suggest it to anyone looking to make their own ergonomic keyboard.\nCase Design\nI wanted Silvis to be able to hold up to abuse. I wanted a rigid case with a durable design. Of course, for those purposes, a 3D printed case probably wasn’t my best choice, but its what I had to work with.\nThe overall design is pretty simple. I have a 3d-printed shell that the PCB drops down into, then a FR4 plate goes over that, with 10 M3 screws holding everything together. I designed all of this in Fusion360.\nSoftware Development\nSoftware for this project was really easy. Over my past keyboard projects I have developed a strong understanding of QMK, so that is what I chose to use again. The only tricky part was configuring the LEDs to work properly.\nUsage\nI’ve now been using Silvis as my daily driver for about 6 months, and it is wonderful. All of my tedious design work really did pay off."},"Blog-Posts/Keyboards/Tantalus":{"title":"Tantalus","links":["Research/Ergonomic-Mechanical-Keyboards/Ergonomic-Keyboards","Blog-Posts/Keyboards/Dactyl-Manuform-R-Track","Concepts/Programming/Programming-Languages/CPP/QMK","KiCad"],"tags":["keyboards"],"content":"Tantalus\nIntroduction\nThis is my 3rd ergonomic keyboard, and my first completely custom design. My previous build, the Dactyl Manuform R-Track, was almost perfect. However I needed another board for my second setup, and really didn’t want to handwire again. So, I set about learning how to design my own 3d models and create my own PCBs. I had a couple goals in mind:\n\nFully Programmable with QMK\n38 Choc Keys with a layout optimized for prose\nCustom PCB with integrated MCU\nUSB-C Connection\nTrackball on a daughterboard\n\nI achieved most of these goals, but in practice it isn’t perfect.\nHardware Development\nThis project was a great learning experience for a number of reasons, but the big one is that I got very acquainted with KiCad, an open source PCB design tool. From scratch, I learned how to create schematics, modify and design footprints, layout a PCB, route a PCB, and read datasheets. Since this was my first design, I kept it somewhat simple. No LEDs, no OLED, no split board, none of the other possible bells and whistles for QMK boards.\nInstead of using a separate daughterboard for the microcontroller as I had on my previous two builds, Tantalus has an ATMEGA32U4 directly on the PCB, along with all of the clock and voltage regulating circuity that entails. This enables me to have a USB-C connection anywhere else on the PCB.\nAnd the PCB Layout:\n\nOnce I finished the PCB, I set to work learning another tool from the ground up: AutoDesk Fusion 360. I needed to create a 3d printable enclosure for the PCB, with a spot for the trackball. I severely underestimated how hard it’d be. After many, many iterations, here is a render of the final design:\n\nAssembly\nI had the PCB manufactured and partially soldered by JLCPCB. Once I had soldered the rest of the components and printed the case, it came time to assemble everything. Unfortunately, everything didn’t go to plan. Some of the tolerances on the case were bad, the wiring was tight, and the trackball sensor interefered with the case closing. Additionally, I made a couple small mistakes on the PCB that rendered two keys non-functional, until I ran jumper wires to fix it. However, with a bit of gumption and a dremel, I was eventually able to get everything fitting and the case to close.\nFinal Product\nWithout further adue, here is how it turned out:\n\nAnd the internals:\n\nIs it janky? Yes. Did I make mistakes? Yes. Am I happy with the final product? Not really. Am I glad I did it? Absolutely. This was a great learning experience."},"Blog-Posts/Posts/BWSI":{"title":"Beaver Works Summer Institute","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Beaver Works Summer Institute\nIntroduction\nIn the summer of 2023, I had the pleasure of attending the Beaver Works Summer Institute, a program for rising high school seniors run by MIT. It offers the brightest students in the nation the chance to work on fascinating engineering projects with courses taught by MIT faculty.\nI chose to take the Autonomous Underwater Vehicle Challenge, where we learned to take a remotely operated underwater robot and transform it into something fully autonomous using sensor data, computer vision, and motor control. Here is what our robot looked like:\n\nPhysics\nThe first step on our journey to autonomy was understanding how the robot moves in the water. It has a 6 thruster configuration, with 4 on the xy plane and 2 for vertical movement. This allows us full control in all 3 dimensions. You can turn the robot (yaw) by turning on opposing horizontal thrusters. We didn’t really bother with pitch and roll, but you should be able to control those to. In order to understand how the robot actually moves, you have to do just a little bit of linear algebra. Thinking only in the 2D plane, you can find the horizontal and vertical components of each thruster using basic trigonometry. You can do the same to calculate torque, assuming you know the dimensions of the robot. Once you have the components relative to the AUV, you can translate them into the global plane using a rotation matrix. Now that calculation only gives us the acceleration of the AUV. You really want the expected position, so you have to integrate twice. This math formed the basis of our first week of study.\nMotor Control\nNow that we had an idea as to how the robot would respond, it was time to learn how to actually control it. We did so using the PID control model, which relies on an error and the change in that error over time in order to calculate how much to change by. Essentially, the speed of the motors depends on how far away from your target you are, and how quickly that distance is changing. This prevents you from overshooting. The code for this is actually exceedingly simple, but the bulk of the work came from testing it on our actual robots and honing in on the gain values.\nComputer Vision\nOkay, so we can control our robot and make it go where we want to now. How do we know, autonomously, where to go? The same way you do: with vision! Our robot is equipped with a high resolution, high refresh rate camera. You can process that image to gather data about the surroundings, and then decide where to go accordingly. For us, we had to main modes of travel: following April Tags (basically QR codes for robots), or following the lane of a pool. April tags stand out quite a bit an image, so they are pretty easy to find and follow. They give a lot of information based on their size in the image, so you can actually follow them pretty accurately. Pool lanes are a lot harder. They are just dark edges at the bottom of the pool, and there is often times multiple of them in the image, so it can be very difficult to detect them all and pick the right one. I would say that this problem is where the bulk of my development work went throughout the 4 week program."},"Blog-Posts/Posts/Biking":{"title":"Biking","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Biking\nResearch\nAs winter settled in and I began to spend more time inside, I was looking to get into a new excerise hobby. I spent a while thinking about it, and eventually decided that I wanted to start biking. I’ve known how to ride a bike for a long time, but I’ve never really had a good one, and never really gone on wrong rides. But after discovering the world of bikepacking and seeing all kinds of adventures documented on YouTube, I decided I was going to get into it. So, I spent about a month looking into all kinds of bikes, from sleek and modern road bikes to full-suspension mountain bikes. I learned a lot from that research. For one, bikes are expensive. There are also a lot of options. There’s suspension, drive trains, rim versus disc brakes, dropbar versus flatbar, and countless other of decisions to make before purchasing a bike. But, eventually, I started to develop an idea of what I wanted.\nThe Poseidon X\nThe bike I settled on, and purchased in December 2022, is the Poseidon X. It is a gravel bike, built for rougher terrain (like on gravel roads!) but not neccarisly bumpy and steep trails like you might tackle on a mountain bike. This seems like a good compromise for me, because I will be doing likely 80-90% of my riding on roads, even if I am excited to get on trails come summer. It is a rigid bike, meaning no front or rear suspension. This makes it easier to maintain and cheaper to purchase. It has a 1x10 cassette, which still offers plenty of range for tackling hills or going downhill.\nAs of January, I haven’t been able to go on any long rides yet due to cold weather. But, from the ~10 mile days I have done, the bike is excellent! Its a blast to ride, with smooth gear shifting, lots of braking power, and good ergonomics. I’m really happy with it!"},"Blog-Posts/Posts/Obsidian":{"title":"Obsidian Notes","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Obsidian Notes\nWhat is Obsidian?\nIn late 2022, I was lucky enough to stumble onto a wonderful project called Obsidian Notes. The principle is simple: a note-taking software composed of plain markdown files with a focus on interconnection and extensibility. You create a folder of markdown files, and use local links, tags, and canvases to connect everything. This allows you to move from file to file as you would thought to thought. It sounds simple, but is extremely powerful in practice.\nBut… why?\nI was skeptical at first too. People online speak of note software like Obsidian as if they will completly change your life, and I didn’t believe them. But, now that I have been using Obsidian for about 3 months, it really does have a big impact on my workflow and thought proccesses. Essentially, whenever I learn a new concept or have an interesting thought I expect to revisit, I write it down in my Obsidian vault, often in shorthand at first. Then, when I have time later, I can expand it fully. Next time I think about that thing, I can just look at my note to refresh my memory. This can also serve as a to-do list; when you think of something you need to do, just write it down. Maybe tag it. Then you come back later. It has a huge impact on my ability to get things done. Fleeting thoughts become reality a lot more now that I use Obsidian.\nDaily Notes\nThe very first place I write down most of these notes and thoughts is my daily note. A daily note is simply a file that you create each day with the date. From my daily notes I can get to everything I worked or thought about that day. In Obsidian, if you want to create a new file, you just write [[$file_name$]], and then hit Ctrl+Enter. This file will then have a “backlink” to your daily note, which can later be viewed graphically. This allows you to visualize ideas and thoughts on a graph, and follow your train of thoughts. This is especially powerful when you return to a project or idea after a long time.\nTags\nAnother hugely important feature of Obsidian is tags. I use tags just as topics. So if I make a file about a physics topic, I just tag it with physics. This can be done in two ways:\n\nInline tags\nYAML Frontmatter\n\nInline tags are just written like#topic directly in your markdown. These are fast to make, but produce visual clutter. YAML Frontmatter tags are written at the very top of the file, like this:\n---\ntags: [xxxxx, yyyyy]\n---\n\nBoth methods work with the other, so you can use whatever you want depending on the note. I tend to use inline tags in my daily notes, but YAML frontmatter for when I extract something to its own file.\nGraph View\nI mentioned the graph view, but I just wanted to give you a visual of what that looks like:\n\nThat is a screenshot of my main Obsidian vault, with over 500 notes. It gives a clear visual of how ideas and tags are related. Most of the grouping comes from tags, but those can be disabled to get a direct view of file-to-file connections, if that is what you are looking for. Its really interesting to visualize what you have learned and thought about for the past months.\nSyncing\nA conventional note-taking approach would involve a notebook, that you can take around with you and write things down in. Obsidian is digital, and not even natively in the cloud. So what do I do if I’m out and about and want to write something down? Well, the way I see it, there are two options:\n\nSync your vault across devices\nTake intermediary notes on another device\n\nI use a mix of both. Sometimes I will write things down on scraps of paper and fold them up in my pocket. Other times, I will write them using Obsidian for my phone (yes, its cross platform!).\nThere are a couple ways to sync a vault from your phone to laptop or similar. Obsidian themselves offer a service called Obsidian Sync, which is $10 a month for cross-platform cloud syncing with version history. A free approach is to setup a Git/GitHub repository, using the obsidian-git plugin.\nConclusion\nSo, I implore you: take a look at Obsidian. It might not be for you, and that’s fine, but if you have ever wanted to try out a note taking software, I truly believe that Obsidian is the best option available."},"Concepts/Concepts":{"title":"Concepts","links":["Concepts/Psychology/Memory/Prototype-(Psychology)","Research/Sources/Myers-Psychology-for-the-AP-Course"],"tags":["psychology","flashcards","psych-unit4"],"content":"Concepts\nConcepts are ideas, rules, or mental groupings of similar objects, events, people, and activities.

This is a rough starting point for finding the arc length, a basic approximation. Let the two points defining this line be P_{i} and P_{i+1}. A shorthand for the distance formula is then written as L = \\left|P_{i-1} \\ P_{i}\\right|.\nIf you take a series of points P_{i}=(x_{i}, y_{i}) along the domain (a, b) and sum the distance between each, you get a better approximate.

You don’t quite know the formula for the volume of a cone, so you want to try and figure it out on your own.\nWell first, let’s think about what a cone really is. It’s a bunch of circles stacked on top of each other, right? You could split a cone into a series of distinct circles. Of course, if you only had like 2 or 3 circles, it wouldn’t really look much like a cone. But if you had 10 or 20 or 1000, it would look a lot like a cone.\nOkay, so we know how to find the volume of a cylinder, right? It’s just the area of the circle times the height, or \\pi r^{2} h. So then the volume of the total cone is just all of the cylinders added up one after the other.\nBut how do you find the radius of each circle? Well if we take the cone and lay it on its side and take a cross-section, what we get is a triangle. If you put the tip of that triangle at the origin of the coordinate plane, then the triangle has three vertices:\n\n0,0\nh,0\nh,r\nwhere h is the height of the cone and r is the largest radius.\nThen, the radius at any point along the cone is just the height of the line between 0,0 and h,r at that point.\n\nThe slope of a line, or rise over run, is basically how steep a line is, and you can find it from two different points on the line. In this case, we have one point at (0,0), basically the start, and another one at (h, r), so the rise is h over a distance of r. Thus, the slope of the line is \\frac{h}{r}.\nThen, the radius at any point x along the cone is just \\frac{h}{r} \\cdot x. So, the volume of one of those discs we are using to make up our cone has a volume of \\pi (\\frac{h}{r}x)^{2} \\cdot t, where t is the thickness. However, if you were to imagine taking infinitely many discs, then each one would have to be smaller and smaller, so t would get closer and closer to being 0.\nBut how do you add together all of those infinitely many discs? We have an operation in math called integrating that does exactly that! Basically, you divide up a big problem into a whole bunch of little ones, and then add them together.\nIn our case, we could write the volume of the cone as V = \\int_{0}^{h}{\\pi \\left(\\frac{r}{h}x\\right)}{^2}dx \nwhich basically means all of the circles with a thickness of dx between 0 and h.\nSee my explanation of integrals here Feynmann Review - Integrals, but essentially doing out the math you get the formula for volume of cone is\n\\boxed{V = \\frac{\\pi r^{2}h}{3}}\n\n @todo write this\n"},"Concepts/Math/Calculus/Integrals/Solids-of-Revolution/Shell-Method":{"title":"Shell Method  ","links":["Concepts/Math/Calculus/Integrals/Integrals","Concepts/Math/Calculus/Solid-of-Revolution","Concepts/Math/Calculus/Integrals/Solids-of-Revolution/Disk-Method","Concepts/Math/Calculus/Integrals/Solids-of-Revolution/Washer-Method","solid-of-revolution"],"tags":["math","math/calculus"],"content":"Shell Method\nTopic: Integrals\nThe shell method is used to calculate the volume of a Solid of Revolution when the Disk Method or Washer Method is not applicable.

For example, dye in a liquid without stirring. We define u to be the concentration at a given point. This depends on the point, and the time after the diffusion began; therefore, u=  u(x,y,z,t).

When you plug in an initial value that is greater or less than a stable point, it will converge towards that value. Conversely, when you plug in a value greater than or less than an unstable point, it will diverge from that value. One side of a semi-stable converges, the other diverges.\nInformation\nA lot of information can be garnered from a autonomous differential equation. First, we can divide the graph into a series of regions R_{i}, separated by critical lines. Consider this autonomous diffeq graph with two critical points:\n\n\nIt is seen that the solution y(x) remains in the subregion R_{i} for all x.\nThe graph is monotonic; that is, either always increasing or decreasing in the subregion R_{i}\nIf y(x) is bounded above by a critical point, then the graph of y(x) must approach the graph of the critical solution y(x) = c_{1} either as x \\to \\infty or x \\to -\\infty.

Then a necessary and sufficient condition that M(x,y)dx + N(x,y)dy be an exact differential is\n\\frac{\\partial M}{\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial N}{\\partial x}\n\nThis is equivalent to the definition of a Gradient Field. This gives us an important fact: solving an exact DE means to find the Potential Function for a vector field.\nSolving\nTo solve a exact differential, first ensure that it matches the criterion above. Then, you must partially integrate twice. Recognize that if the condition is true, there must exist a function f for which\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = M(x, y)\nThen we can start solving f by integrating M(x, y) with respect to x while holding y constant:\nf(x,y) = \\int\\limits_{}^{}{M(x,y)dx + g(y)}\nwhere the arbitrary function g(y) is the “constant of integration.” Now it is known that \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = N(x, y). So if we differentiate as such, we find that\n\\frac{\\partial{f}}{\\partial{x}} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial{y}} \\int\\limits_{}^{}{M(x,y)dx} + g&#039;(y) = N(x,y)\ng&#039;(y) = N(x,y) - \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial{y}} \\int\\limits_{}^{}{M(x,y)dx}\nThen we find g(y) by integrating both sides:\ng(y) = \\int\\limits_{}^{}{(N(x,y) - \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial{y}} \\int\\limits_{}^{}{M(x,y)dx}dy}\nThen you add this back into the earlier equation for g(y), to find f(x, y) = c.\nWe could start this process with y instead of x as well. That would give us\nf(x,y) = \\int\\limits_{}^{}{N(x,y)dy} + h(x) \\quad \\text{ and } \\quad h&#039;(x) = M(x,y) - \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial{x}} \\int\\limits_{}^{}{N(x,y)dy}\nMaking a DE Exact\nIt is sometimes possible to find an integrating factor so that after multiplying the left-hand side you get\n\\mu(x,y)M(x,y)dx + \\mu(x,y)N(x,y)dy = 0\nas an exact differential. To find \\mu(x,y), we note first that the above equation is exact if and only if \\frac{\\partial{\\mu M}}{\\partial{y}} = \\frac{\\partial{\\mu N}}{\\partial{x}} is true. By the product rule of differentiation, that expands to\n\\frac{\\partial{M}}{\\partial{y}} \\mu  + \\frac{\\partial{\\mu}}{\\partial{y}} M = \\frac{\\partial{N}}{\\partial{x}}\\mu + \\frac{\\partial{\\mu}}{\\partial{x}} N\\quad\\text{ or} \\quad\\mu_{x}N - \\mu_{y}M = (M_{y} - N_{x})- \\mu\nwhere the subscript denotes partials. Now this is actually a Partial Differential Equation, which we can’t tackle with skills from chapter 2. Therefore, we make the simplification that \\mu is a function of only one variable. For example, say that \\mu depends only on x. In this case, \\mu_{x} = \\frac{d\\mu}{dx} and \\mu_{y} = 0, so the above can be written as\n\\frac{d\\mu}{dx} = \\frac{M_{y} - N_{x}}{N}\\mu\nThe same process could be done to state that \\mu depends only on y.\nFinally, from solving the above equation, we have that, if \\frac{M_{y}-N_{x}}{N} is a function of x alone, then an integrating factor is\n\\mu(x) = e^{\\int\\limits_{}^{}{\\frac{M_{y} - N_{x}}{N}dx}}\nif \\frac{N_{x} - M_{y}}{M} is a function of y alone, then an integrating factor is\n\\mu(y) = e^{\\int\\limits_{}^{}{\\frac{N_{x} - M_{y}}{M}dy}}\nThree Variable Exacts\nIf you have an exact Differential, which can be checked using the method seen in Gradient Fields in Space, then the solution method is very similar to that of the two-variable technique. (also see alternative method: In Space).\nOur goal is to find the Potential Function f(x,y,z) such that \\nabla f = \\vec{\\textbf{F}} = \\langle P(x,y,z), Q(x,y,z), R(x,y,z)\\rangle.

Methods of solution include Solutions by Reduction of Order and, most importantly, Solutions of Homogeneous Linear Equations with Constant Coefficients.\nNow is the difficult part, and also the name sake: we GUESS a possible solution with undetermined coefficients, and then try to use it find a particular solution. For example, we might guess a possible solution for g(x) = 5x + 7 will be of the form y_{p} = Ax + B. This guess is very educated, however: it comes from the fact that when we take the derivatives of y_{p} and substitute them into our specific equation L(y), it must sum to g(x).\nWe solve for the coefficients A, B, C, \\dots, Z by setting up a System of Equations to find an exact y_{p}\nSubstitute our found y_{p} and y_{c} to finally obtain a general solution y = y_{c} + y_{p}\n\nExamples\n\n\n                  \n                  Example 1 \n                  \n                \n\nSolve y&#039;&#039; - 2y&#039; -3y = 4x - 5 + 6xe^{2x}.\nFirst, the solution of the associated homogeneous equation y&#039;&#039; - 2y&#039; -3y = 0 is found to be y_{c} = c_{1}e^{-x} + c_{2}e^{3x}. See Solutions of Homogeneous Linear Equations with Constant Coefficients.\nThen, we must find a particular. Let y_{p} = y_{p1} + y_{p2}, where y_{p1} is matched with the polynomial term (y_{p1} = Ax + B) and y_{p2} is matched with the exponential term such that y_{p2} = Cxe^{2x} + Ee^{2x}. Thus, y_{p} = Ax + B + Cxe^{2x} + Ee^{2x}\nWe then take the derivatives of this, y_{p}&#039; = Ax + 2Cxe^{2x} + Ce^{2x}+ 2Ee^{2x} and y_{p}&#039;&#039; = 4Ce^{2x} + 4Cxe^{2x} + 4E e^{2x} and substitute, yielding\ny_{p}&#039;&#039; - 2y_{p}&#039; -3y_{p} = -3Ax - 2A - 3B - 3Cxe^{2x} + (2C - 3E)e^{2x} = 4x - 5 + 6xe^{2x}\nThis gives a System of Equations with 4 equations,\n-3A = 4, -2A - 3B = -5, -3C = 6, and 2C - 3E = 0. Solving, we find A = -\\frac{4}{3}, B = \\frac{23}{9}, C = -2, and E = - \\frac{4}{3}.

This can make the process much easier.\n\n\n                  \n                  Example 2 \n                  \n                \n\nFind the solution of y&#039;&#039; - 5y&#039; + 4y = 8e^{x}.\nFirst, we find y_{c} = c_{1}e^{4x} + c_{2}e^{x}.\nThen, intuitively, we would guess our particular solution to be of the form y_{p} = Ae^{x}. Then we take the derivatives y&#039; = Ae^{x}, y&#039;&#039; = Ae^{x}, so Ae^{x} - 5Ae^{x} + 4Ae^{x} = 0 = 8e^{x}\nObviously, something went wrong here. The issue is that our assumed solution function e^{x} is already present in y_{c}. There is overlap. Therefore, we have to guess a different linearly independent solution, y_{p} = Axe^{x}. Subistuting that and simplifying gives us -3Ae^{x} = 8e^{x} \\to A = - \\frac{8}{3}. Therefore, a particular solution is y_{p} = \\frac{-8}{3}xe^{x} and our general solution is \\boxed{y = c_{1}e^{4x} + c_{2}e^{x} - \\frac{8}{3} xe^{x}}\n\n\nExample 2 reveals an important truth: our particular solution must be linearly independent of the complementary function\n\nReferences\nA First Course in Differential Equations with Modeling Applications; Chapter 4.4"},"Concepts/Math/Differential-Equations/Partial-Differential-Equations":{"title":"Partial Differential Equations","links":["Concepts/Math/Differential-Equations/Differential-Equations","Concepts/Math/Multivariable-Calculus/Derivatives/Partial-Derivatives","Concepts/Math/Functions/Functions","Concepts/Science/Physics/Fluid-Dynamics/Navier-Stokes-Equations","Concepts/Science/Physics/Quantum-Mechanics/Quantum-Mechanics","General-Relativity","Concepts/Science/Physics/Thermodynamics/Thermodynamics","Differential-Geometry","Concepts/Math/Differential-Equations/Forms/Ordinary-Differential-Equations","Concepts/Math/Differential-Equations/Theory/General-Solution"],"tags":["math/diffeqs"],"content":"Partial Differential Equations\nTopic: Differential Equations\nA partial differential equation, shortened to PDE, is a Differential Equation that relates the Partial Derivatives of a Multivariable Function.

We then use these Eigenvalues to find the Eigenvectors. For \\lambda_{1}: A - \\lambda I = \\begin{pmatrix}2-1 &amp; 2 \\\\ 1 &amp; 3-1\\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix}1 &amp; 2 \\\\ 1 &amp; 2\\end{pmatrix} which implies that k_{1} + 2k_{2} = 0 \\Longrightarrow k_{1} = -2 k_{2}. We choose k_{2}=1 to get the Eigenvector \\begin{pmatrix}-2 \\\\ 1\\end{pmatrix}\nFor \\lambda_{2} = 4: A - \\lambda I = \\begin{pmatrix}-2 &amp; 2 \\\\ 1 &amp; -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\Longrightarrow \\begin{pmatrix}1 &amp; -1 \\\\ 0 &amp; 0\\end{pmatrix}\nwhich implies that k_{1} = k_{2} so therefore the Eigenvector is \\begin{pmatrix}1 \\\\ 1\\end{pmatrix}. The general solution is thus X = c_{1} \\begin{pmatrix}-2 \\\\ 1\\end{pmatrix} e^{t} + c_{2} \\begin{pmatrix}1 \\\\ 1\\end{pmatrix} e^{4t}\n\n\n\nReferences\nA First Course in Differential Equations with Modeling Applications; Chapter 8.2"},"Concepts/Math/Differential-Equations/Theory/Superposition-Principle-for-Homogeneous-Systems-of-Linear-Differential-Equations":{"title":"Superposition Principle for Homogeneous Systems of Linear Differential Equations","links":["Concepts/Math/Differential-Equations/Theory/General-Solution","Concepts/Math/Differential-Equations/Forms/Ordinary-Differential-Equations","Concepts/Math/Differential-Equations/Theory/Homogeneous","Concepts/Math/Differential-Equations/Theory/Systems-of-Linear-Differential-Equations","Concepts/Math/Differential-Equations/Theory/Solution-Vectors","Concepts/Math/Linear-Algebra/Linear-Combinations","Concepts/Math/Linear-Algebra/Linear-Independence-of-Solution-Vectors","Textbooks/Math/A-First-Course-in-Differential-Equations/A-First-Course-in-Differential-Equations-with-Modeling-Applications"],"tags":["math/diffeqs"],"content":"Superposition Principle for Homogeneous Systems of Linear Differential Equations\nMuch like the Superposition Principle for Ordinary Differential Equations, the superposition principle for Homogeneous Systems of Linear Differential Equations is defined as:\n\n\n                  \n                  Superposition Principle \n                  \n                \n\nLet X_{1}, X_{2}, \\dots, X_{k} be a set of Solution Vectors of the homogeneous system X&#039; = AX on an interval I.

The coordinates of a 2d vector, or the values, tell you where it is pointing to. The first value says how far to go parallel to the x-axis, and the second how far to go parallel to the y-axis.\n3D Vectors\nThe same idea applies for 3D vectors. The first number tells you the x-axis, the second y, and the third z.\nVector Operations\nVector Addition\nTo add two vectors, move the tail of one vector to the head of the other. The vector from the origin to the position that the second vector now points to is the result of the addition.\nYou can think of this as taking steps along the plane corresponding to the directions of both vectors, and where you end up.\n\\begin{bmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{bmatrix}\n+\n\\begin{bmatrix} c \\\\ d \\end{bmatrix} \n= \n\\begin{bmatrix} a+c \\\\ b+d \\end{bmatrix} \nVector Multiplication\nIf you multiply a vector by a positive constant, you stretch it out by that factor.

This can then be packaged into a 2x2 matrix, where the columns are the vectors where i and j land.

Instead, you find the product of the shear and rotation as a new separate matrix, and just multiply by that.\nTo do this numerically, we will need to read right to left. Look at i after the first, that is the right, matrix. Multiply it by the second, left matrix, to get the first column of the product.

Geographically, they have the properties that lines remain lines, and the origin remains fixed. It is important to remember that means all lines, not just horizontal or vertical ones.\nMore mathematically, a transformation L is linear if it satisfies the following two properties:\n&amp;L \\text{ preserves sums: } &amp;L(\\vec{v} + \\vec{w}) &amp;= L(\\vec{v }) + L (\\vec{w})\\\\\n&amp;L \\text{ preserves scaling: } &amp;L(s \\vec{v})&amp;= sL(\\vec{v})\n\\end{aligned}$$\n\nThis is actually very restrictive, because it says that the relationship of a vector to its basis [[vectors]] before transformation will be the same as the transformations relation to the transformed basis [[vectors]]:\n\n$$L(-1 \\hat{\\textbf{i}} + 2 \\hat{\\textbf{j}}) = L(-1 \\hat{\\textbf{i}}) + L(2 \\hat{\\textbf{j}}) = -1 L(\\hat{\\textbf{i}}) + 2 L(\\hat{\\textbf{j}})$$\nTherefore, if you know where the [[Basis Vectors]] go through a linear transformation, you can find where everything else goes.\n\n## Mathematical Representation\nHow is a linear transformation actually done? Say a rotation for graphics. What do you tell the computer to do?\n\nWell, the only information you need is where $\\hat{\\textbf{i}}$ lands and where $\\hat{\\textbf{j}}$ lands. In the 2D plane, that is just 4 numbers. These numbers are packaged into a $2 \\times 2$ grid of numbers, like this:\n$$\\begin{bmatrix} a &amp; b \\\\ c &amp; d\\end{bmatrix}$$\nThen you need a function that takes in any general vector and applies this transformation to it, using those four numbers. This is done via [[Matrix-Vector Multiplication]]:\n![[Matrix-Vector Multiplication]]\n\n## Composition of Transformations\nYou often need to apply two transformations in sequence. You might shear, and then rotate. To get to any combination of transformations, you could apply them to a vector one by one. For example, you could multiply a vector by a shear matrix, and then multiply the result of that by the rotation matrix. This could, however, be done in a single operation by multiplying the vector by a new matrix, which is the product of the two others.\nFor a rotation and then shear, this would be:\n$$\\begin{bmatrix}1 &amp; 1 \\\\ 0 &amp; 1\\end{bmatrix}\\begin{bmatrix}0 &amp; -1 \\\\ 1 &amp; 0\\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix}1 &amp; -1 \\\\ 1 &amp; 0\\end{bmatrix}$$\nNote that the transformations are applied right to left. Think of it like function notation: $f(g(\\vec{v}))$. We evaluate $g$ first.\n\nGenerally, this process is called [[Matrix Multiplication]]:\n![[Matrix Multiplication]]\n\n## Three-dimensional Linear Transformations\n\nIn three-dimensions, each position is represented by three components. In the standard [[Euclidean Space]], our basis [[vectors]] are typically $\\hat{\\textbf{i}}$, $\\hat{\\textbf{j}}$, and $\\hat{\\textbf{k}}$. A transformation of these basis [[vectors]] can be represented by a 3x3 matrix, detailing where $\\hat{\\textbf{i}}$ lands, $\\hat{\\textbf{j}}$ lands, and $\\hat{\\textbf{k}}$ lands. You then input a vector $\\begin{bmatrix}x \\\\ y \\\\ z\\end{bmatrix}$, like this:\n\n\\begin{bmatrix}a &amp; b &amp; c \\ d &amp; e &amp; f \\ g &amp; h &amp; i\\end{bmatrix}\\begin{bmatrix}x \\ y \\ z\\end{bmatrix} = x \\begin{bmatrix}a \\ d \\ g\\end{bmatrix} + y \\begin{bmatrix}b \\ e \\ h\\end{bmatrix} + z \\begin{bmatrix}c \\ f \\ i\\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix}ax + by + c z \\ dx + ey + fz \\ gx + hy + iz \\end{bmatrix}\n\nOr, you can combine multiple transformations like this:\n\n$$\\begin{bmatrix}a &amp; b &amp; c \\\\ d &amp; e &amp; f \\\\ g &amp; h &amp; i\\end{bmatrix}\\begin{bmatrix}q &amp; r &amp; s \\\\ t &amp; u &amp; v \\\\ x &amp; y &amp; z\\end{bmatrix} = $$"},"Concepts/Math/Linear-Algebra/Matrices/Matrices":{"title":"Matrices","links":[],"tags":["math/linear-algebra","bwsi"],"content":"Matrices\nA matrix is simply a set of numbers arranged into rows and columns.\nFor example:\nM = \\begin{bmatrix} -2 &amp; 5 &amp; 6 \\\\ 5 &amp; 2 &amp; 7 \\end{bmatrix} \nA matrix has a size based on its dimensions.

You will &quot;expand&quot; this choice. I will typically use the top one. We will expand from left to right.\nFor each element, cross out everything in that elements row and column. Then, find the determinant of what remains. For example, in that given matrix, you would start with $\\hat{\\textbf{i}}$, for which you would find the determinant of:\n\\det\\begin{bmatrix}a_{y} &amp; a_{z} \\ b_{y} &amp; b_{z} \\end{bmatrix}\nTwo find the determinant of a 2x2, you just use the rule left diagonal - right diagonal. For this 2x2, that is $a_{y}b_{z} - a_{z}b_{y}$. So, the $\\hat{\\textbf{i}}$ term is $\\hat{\\textbf{i}}(a_{y}b_{z} - a_{z}b_{y})$.\n\nYou then do the same process for $\\hat{\\textbf{j}}$ and $\\hat{\\textbf{k}}$. But! You must also remember the sign matrix, multiplying each term by its corresponding sign:\n$$\\begin{bmatrix}+ &amp; - &amp; + \\\\ - &amp; + &amp; - \\\\ + &amp; - &amp;+\\end{bmatrix}$$\n### Geometric Theorem in Space\nGeometrically, the $\\det(\\vec{A}, \\vec{B}, \\vec{C}) = \\pm \\text{volume of parallelepiped formed by those three vectors}$. The parallelepiped is just a fancy word for box with parallelogram sides.\n\nAnother way to find the volume of such a space is \n$$\\vec{A} \\cdot (\\vec{B} \\times \\vec{C})$$\nthis is known as the [[Triple Scalar Product]].\n\n### Determinant Facts\nLet |A| be the determinant of a matrix A.\n- |A| is multiplied by -1 if we interchange two rows or columns\n- |A| = 0 if one row or column is all zero, or if two rows or two columns are the same\n- |A| is multiplied by c if the matrix is piecewise multiplied by c\n- |A| is unchanged if we add to one row a constant multiple of another row\n### Applications of Determinants in 2D\n\nConsider a triangle. Any triangle you want. Let the adjacent side be formed by $\\vec{A}$ and the hypotenuse be $\\vec{B}$. Let the sides be separated by angle $\\theta$. How would you find the area of this triangle?\n\nOf course, the area of a triangle is $\\frac{1}{2} bh$. The base of the triangle is just $|\\vec{A}|$. The height $h$ is $\\sin{(\\theta)} \\times |\\vec{B}|$. The area is then \n$$\\frac{1}{2} |\\vec{A}| |\\vec{B}| \\sin{(\\theta)}$$\nBut, given two [[vectors]], how do you find the angle $\\theta$? The easiest way is with [[Vector Dot Products#computing-angles|Computing Angles]]. However, that gives us $\\cos{(\\theta)}$, so then you have to use the Pythagorean Identity and it gets quite ugly. So instead, we can do some geometry!\n\nWe want the value $\\sin{(\\theta)}$. For any angle $\\theta$, there exists a complementary angle $\\theta&#039;$ such that $\\sin{(\\theta)} = \\cos{(\\theta&#039;)}$. In particular, the angle $\\theta&#039;$ is formed by rotating $\\vec{A}$ by 90 degrees counterclockwise, forming the vector $\\vec{A&#039;} = [-a_{2}, a_{1}]$ (this can be seen by geometry, or done using a rotation matrix). The length of A&#039; is equal to the length of A. Therefore, \n$$\\cos{(\\theta&#039;)} = \\frac{\\vec{A&#039;} \\cdot \\vec{B}}{|A&#039;||B|}= \\sin{(\\theta)}$$\nPlugging this into our previous formula for area, we have\n$$\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} (\\vec{A&#039;} \\cdot \\vec{B}) = \\frac{1}{2}(-a_{2}b_{1} + b_{2}a_{1}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\det{\\begin{bmatrix}a_{1} &amp; a_{2} \\\\ b_{1} &amp; b_{2}\\end{bmatrix}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\det[\\vec{A}, \\vec{B}]$$\nNote that this area can be $\\pm$ depending on the angle $\\theta$, so it is more accurate to say that the above is $\\pm \\text{Area}$.\n\nMore generally, this gives us a very elegant geometric representation of the determinant: the absolute value of the determinant of two 2D [[vectors]] is the area of the quadrilateral which they form.

This method is proven in Angle Between Two Vectors.\nDetermining Orthogonality\nIf the dot product of two vectors is 0, they are orthogonal.\nTake the equation x + 2y + 3z = 0. Consider a vector pointing to a point in space, \\vec{OP} = (x, y, z). In order for the point OP to satisfy the equation it must be true that the dot product of \\vec{OP} and \\vec{A} = (1, 2, 3) equals 0, because \\vec{OP} \\cdot \\vec{A} = x + 2y + 3z = 0. In this case, that means that \\vec{OP} is orthogonal to \\vec{A}. The set of points for which this is true defines a plane.\nAn easier example of this is that the horizontal plane could be defined as the set of points orthogonal to \\hat{\\textbf{k}}.\n\n\n                  \n                  Determine when points are at right angle \n                  \n                \n\nLet P = (a, 1, -1), Q = (0, 1, 1), and R = (a, -1, 3). At what values of a do the three points form a right angle \\angle PQR?\nApproach: Form vectors and solve for dot product equals 0.\nSolution: Let \\vec{QP} = (a, 0, -2) and \\vec{QR} = (a, -2, 2). When the dot product of these two vectors \\vec{QP} \\cdot \\vec{QR} = 0, the angle between them is 90 degrees.\n\\vec{QP} \\cdot \\vec{QR} = a^{2} + 0 - 4 = 0 \\to \\boxed{a = \\pm 2}\n\n\nVector Components\n\n\n                  \n                  What is the component of \\vec{A} along a unit vector \\hat{\\textbf{u}}?\n                  \n                \n\nYou can consider the right triangle formed with \\vec{A} as hypotenuse, adjacent side in the direction of \\hat{\\textbf{u}}, and opposite side orthogonal to \\hat{\\textbf{u}} and connected to the tip of \\vec{A}. In this triangle, \\vec{A} and \\hat{\\textbf{u}} form an angle \\theta. The length of the adjacent side, or the length along \\hat{\\textbf{u}}, is given by \\cos{(\\theta)} \\vec{A}.

In simpler terms, $w$ is a function that depends on $u_{1}, u_{2}, \\dots, u_{n}$, where each of those variables $u_{i}$ itself depends on other variables $x_{1}, x_{2}, \\dots, x_{n}$. When we take the derivative of this function $w$, we must take into account the rate at which $w$ changes due to a nudge in each of $u_{i}$; but we must also consider the rate at which $u_{i}$ changes due to a nudge in each of $x_{j}$. We succinctly summarize this mathematically, using [[Einstein Notation]], as \n\n$$\\boxed{\\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial x_{j}} = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial u_{i}} \\frac{\\partial u_{i}}{\\partial x_{j}}}$$\n\n***\n\n## References\nwww.youtube.com/watch\n[[1802SC - Multivariable Calculus]] - Session 32"},"Concepts/Math/Multivariable-Calculus/Derivatives/Constrained-Differentials":{"title":"Constrained Differentials","links":["Concepts/Math/Multivariable-Calculus/Multivariable-Calculus","Concepts/Math/Multivariable-Calculus/Derivatives/Partial-Differentiation-with-Dependent-Variables","Concepts/Math/Multivariable-Calculus/Derivatives/Total-Differential","Concepts/Math/Calculus/Derivatives/Rules/Derivative-Product-Rule"],"tags":["math/calculus/multi"],"content":"Constrained Differentials\nTopic: Multivariable Calculus\nThis is simply the application of Partial Differentiation with Dependent Variables.\n\n\n                  \n                  Constrained Differential \n                  \n                \n\nConsider a right triangle with base a, hypotenuse b, and angle between them \\theta.

What is the area of the ellipse?\nSolution:\nFinding the bounds of integration for this is very difficult. What we can do is rescale it into some other coordinate system xy \\Rightarrow uv where the ellipse becomes the unit circle. This is done by simp\\iinting u = \\frac{x}{a}, v = \\frac{y}{b}, so du = \\frac{1}{a}dx, dv = \\frac{1}{b}dy.

Then, we can approximate that \\Delta u = u_{x}\\Delta x + u_{y} \\Delta y and \\Delta v = v_{x}\\Delta x + v_{y} \\Delta y (see Partial Derivatives).

Therefore, the first derivative should be 0:\nP&#039;(0) = c_{1} + 2c_{2}(0) + \\dots = c_{1} = 0\nYou can continue this down and down:\n\\frac{d^{2}\\cos{}}{dx^{2}}(0) = -\\cos{(0)} = -1\n\\frac{d^{2}P}{dx^{2}}(0) = 2c_{2} = -1 \\to c_{2} = -\\frac{1}{2}\n\\frac{d^{3}\\cos{}}{dx^{2}}(0) = \\sin{(0)} = 0\n\\frac{d^{3}P}{dx^{3}}(0) = 6c_{3} = 0 \\to c_{3} = 0\n…\nContinuing this process, we find that the coefficient of our constant for any given step is factorial. Also note that the new term doesn’t affect previous terms. We find that P(x) is:\nP(x) = 1 - \\frac{x^{2}}{2!} + \\frac{x^{4}}{4!} - \\frac{x^{6}}{6!} + \\dots - \\frac{x_{n}}{n!}\nGeneralizing\nIf you are trying to approximate somewhere other than 0, a value c, then the polynomial becomes\nP_{c}(x) = c_{0} + c_{1}(x - c)^{1} + c_{2}(x - c)^{2} + c_{3}(x - c)^{3} + \\dots + c_{n}(x - c)^{n}\nTo find the Taylor Series approximation for a given function, we take a function and as many derivatives as we want, then evaluate them all at x = a. The coefficients of the polynomial terms become each derivative’s evaluation divided by n!:\nf(x) \\approx f(a) + \\frac{df}{dx}(a) \\frac{(x-a)^{1}}{1!} + \\frac{d^{2}f}{dx^{2}}(a) \\frac{(x-a)^{2}}{2!} + \\frac{d^{3}f}{dx^{3}}(a) \\frac{(x-a)^{3}}{3!} + \\dots\nThe value a determines where this approximation is accurate.\nThe first term ensures that the approximation equals the function at a given value, the second term ensures that the slope is equal, the third term ensures that the rate of the slopes change is equal, and so on. The more terms you use, the more accurate you are.\n\nReferences\nwww.youtube.com/watch"},"Concepts/Math/Series-and-Sequences/Triangle-Numbers":{"title":"Triangle Numbers","links":["Series-and-Sequences"],"tags":["math/sequences"],"content":"Triangle Numbers\nTopic: Series and Sequences\n1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, ... \\frac{n^{2}+n}{2}\nThis sequence emerges when you consider a series of equilateral triangles consisting of dots.

When you go from one coordinate system Z to another Z&#039;, the Euclidean position P doesn’t change, but the components of our representation of the point does (P(u, v) \\to P(u&#039;, v&#039;)). Our vector needs to point to the same location, and that happens by the basis vector varying with the scale inversely as the components do.

In Curvilinear Coordinates, they are not. A prime example of this is Polar Coordinates: as R increases, so does \\hat{\\theta}.

Basis vectors are similar to Unit Vectors, but there is no requirement that they must be of length 1.\nRank\nThe rank of a tensor describes how many variables are required to index it. For example, a tensor of rank 0 requires 0 variables to index it, or so it has 0 basis vectors. This is just a scalar. A tensor of rank 1 requires 1 variable to index it, it has 1 basis vector. A tensor of rank 2 requires 2 variables to index it, and so on.\nExamples\nRank 0\nScalar\nRank 1\nVector\nRank 2\nMatrix, Stress Tensor\nRank 3\nList of matrices\nTransformation Rules\nA tensor is like a matrix, but it has physical significance.\nLinear Transformation\nCoordinate System Change\n\nA change of coordinate system does not the underlying function. Consider a stress tensor. The underlying deformation of an object under a stress tensor won’t change if you go from one coordinate system to another.\nSuppose L is a coordinate transformation operator applied to a tensor. The magnitude of the components will change according to L, but the basis vectors will transform according to L^{-1}, such that there is no net change.\n\nContravariance\nContravariance is a key term to describing how tensors transform in different coordinate systems. It is best described by example of a vector. Consider a standard Cartesian coordinate system measured in meters describing an object’s position. The basis vectors are each 1 meter long. Now, transform that coordinate system by turning the basis from meters to centimeters: that is, dividing each basis vector by 100 so that they are each .01 meters long. In order for the vector to still describe the same point, the components of the position vector are multiplied by the inverse of this basis scaling factor - multiplied by 100. Because the vector’s components scale inversely to changes in scale to the reference axes, the position vector is called a contravariant tensor. Contravariant basis vectors of a tensor are denoted with superscript, for example T_{j}.\nCovariance\nCovariance is the inverse of contravariance; components scale with changes to the basis vectors. Typically, the covariant basis vectors of a tensor are denoted with subscript, for example T_{i}.\nMixed Tensors\nA mixed tensor is one which is neither strictly covariant nor strictly contravariant; it has some subscript and some superscript basis vectors. For example, a mixed tensor might be written as T_{ij}.\nMoment of Inertia Tensor\nA common example is the moment of inertia tensor.\n\nReferences\nWhat’s a Tensor? by Dan Fleisch\nIntroduction to Tensors by Faculty of Khan\nIntroduction to Tensors: Transformation Rules\nwandb.ai/vincenttu/intro-to-tensors/reports/A-Gentle-Intro-To-Tensors-With-Examples—VmlldzozMTQ2MjE5\nTensors Explained Intuitively: Covariant, Contravariant, Rank by Eugene Khutoryansky\nExamples of Higher Rank Tensors\nCovariance and Contravariance of Vectors\nMoment of Inertia: Inertia Tensor\nTensors"},"Concepts/Math/Tensor-Calculus/Vector-Differentiation":{"title":"Vector Differentiation","links":["Concepts/Math/Calculus/Derivatives/Instantaneous-Rate-of-Change","Concepts/Math/Multivariable-Calculus/Integrals/Vector-Fields","Concepts/Math/Functions/Functions","Concepts/Math/Linear-Algebra/Vectors/Vectors","Concepts/Math/Calculus/Integrals/Solids-of-Revolution/Arc-Length","Concepts/Math/Geometry/Curves-in-Space","Concepts/Math/Linear-Algebra/Vectors/Unit-Vectors","Concepts/Math/Tensor-Calculus/Vector-Transformations"],"tags":["math/tensors","math/calculus"],"content":"Vector Differentiation\nWe know how to take the derivative of a scalar function (Derivative). But what does the instantaneous rate of change of a Vector Function look like, and how do we calculate it?\nIntuitively, we expect that the derivative of a function that returns a vector would give us the rate and direction at which a function is changing at any given point.\nWith Respect to Arc Length\nLet’s consider a position function. Let the function \\vec{P}(s) be a position function that takes in the Arc Length s along curve and returns the position vector to that point on the curve. Using the limit definition of a derivative, we state that \\vec{P}&#039;(s) = \\frac{d \\vec{P}(s)}{ds} = \\lim_{\\Delta s \\to 0} \\frac{\\vec{P}(s + \\Delta s) - \\vec{P}(s)}{\\Delta s}\nThis result is a vector divided by a constant, which is itself a vector. In the limit, the difference of the vectors in the numerator points tangent to the curve. Again, in the limit, \\vec{P}&#039;(s) \\to 1. Therefore, the derivative of a vector with respect to arc length is a unit tangent vector.\nOther Parameters\nIf the position function isn’t a function of arc length, but instead something like time, we use composition.

This releases an enormous amount of energy.\nExample\nInitially, I was confused. We are often told that neutrons and protons have pretty much the same mass, so how does going from one configuration of those to another produce any energy? Well, it turns out that the difference between the mass of a proton and a neutron, and perhaps more accurately the difference between the masses of various common isotopes, is big enough to matter. See this example:\nIn the core of the Sun, Hydrogen is being converted into Helium. Specifically, the isotope H-4 (2 Protons, 2 Neutrons).\nAccording to Western Washington University, this resulting helium particle has an atomic mass of 4.00268 Atomic Mass Units (AMU).1 The four H-1 atoms that might be fused to produced it would have a mass of approximately 4.03130 AMU. The difference is therefore 0.02862 AMU, or 0.71% of the original mass.\nLet’s say that we have 4 grams of hydrogen in a nuclear fusion reaction to produce helium. When we apply Einstein’s famous energy-mass equation, we find that:\nE = mc^{2} = (4 \\text{ g} \\times 0.0071)(3 \\times 10^{8} \\text{ m/s}^{2}) = 2.6\\times 10^{11} \\text{ J}\nThat’s a lot of energy!

The moment of inertia of a larger object can be found by approximating the object as a sum of point masses. Let \\delta(x,y) be the density at point (x,y).

Specifically, it is a gas which we make certain assumptions about so that we can more accurately and reliably model it using kinetic theory. The assumptions are:\n\nThere are a large number of molecules, N, each of mass m, moving in random directions with a variety of speeds\nThe molecules are, on average, separated by an amount much greater than the diameter of each molecule\nMolecules obey the laws of classical mechanics, and interact only in collisions; attractive forces are negligible\nCollisions are assumed to be perfectly elastic and of very short duration\n\nUnder these assumptions, we can do some pretty interesting physics to derive a relationship between the kinetic energy and the temperature of a gas.\nConsider a container with a side of area A. It is filled with a gas of N molecules, each mass m. Consider a single molecule of that gas, with an initial velocity \\vec{v} = v_{x}. It collides with the wall, creating a perfectly elastic collision and bouncing back with a velocity of - v_{x}. The wall therefore must exert a force of F = \\frac{dP}{dt} = \\frac{2mv_{x}}{dt} on the molecule. The molecule bounces back, hits the other wall, and then returns travelling a total distance of 2 \\ell over a time v_{x}\\Delta t \\to \\Delta t = \\frac{2\\ell}{v_{x}}.

However, we have observed that the speed of light is constant regardless of how you are moving. That is contradictory; if you are moving at the speed of light towards a flashlight, shouldn’t the light particles be traveling towards you at a speed of 2c?\nWell, to solve that discrepancy, Einstein devised the idea of relativity; that time and space distort around an object, becoming more distorted as the object moves at a larger percentage of c.\nA famous example of this is clocks. If you have three stationary clocks at different places, they will all see time in the same manner; after an hour has passed, all should show that an hour has passed. Now, take one of the clocks and let it move at 95% the speed of light.

By the technique outlined in Solutions of Homogeneous Linear Equations with Constant Coefficients, we can find that \\lambda = \\pm i \\omega \\Longrightarrow x(t) = c_{1} \\cos{(\\omega t)} + c_{2} \\sin{(\\omega t)}\nThis is also written as x(t) = A \\sin{( \\omega t + \\phi)}\nwhere A = \\sqrt{c_{1}^{2} + c_{2}^{2}} and \\phi = \\arctan{(\\frac{c_{1}}{c_{2}})}, as determined by the initial conditions. (or a similarly shifted cosine function, x(t) = A \\cos{(\\omega t - \\phi)}).\n\n\n                  \n                  Example: Finding the Equation of Motion \n                  \n                \n\nA force of 400 Newtons stretches a spring 2 meters. A mass of 50 kilograms is attached to the end of the spring, and it is initially released from the equilibrium position with an upward velocity of 10 m/s. Find the equation of motion.\nSolution:\nFirst, we identify the given condition that x&#039;(0) = 10 \\text{ m/s}. The spring constant is F = kx \\to k = \\frac{F}{x} = \\frac{400 \\text{ N}}{2 \\text{ m}} =200 \\text{ N/m}. The equation of motion is \\sum\\limits F = ma = mg - k(x - s) = mg - kx - ks = -kx\nwhich yields ma + kx = 0, where a = \\frac{d^{2}x}{dt^{2}}. If we let \\omega = \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}} = 2 \\text{ rad/s}, then we have the differential equation x&#039;&#039; + \\omega^{2} x = 0.\nTo solve this, we let x = e^{\\lambda t}, such that x&#039;&#039; = \\lambda^{2} e^{\\lambda t}. The system then becomes \\lambda^{2} + \\omega^{2} = 0, so \\lambda = \\pm i \\omega. The general solution to the system is then x(t) = c_{1}e^{2i  t} + c_{2}e^{-2i t} = c_{1}&#039; \\cos{(2 t)} + c_{2}&#039; \\sin{(2 t)}\nNow, we apply the condition that x&#039;(0) = -2 c_{1} \\sin{(0)} + 2c_{2} \\cos{(0)} = 2c_{2} = -10 \\to c_{2} = -5. Therefore, the final equation of motion is \\boxed{x(t) = -5 \\sin{(2t)}}\n\n\n\nReferences\nPhysics for Scientists &amp; Engineers with Modern Physics; Chapter 14"},"Concepts/Science/Physics/Waves/SHM/Physical-Pendulum":{"title":"Physical Pendulum ","links":["Concepts/Science/Physics/Waves/SHM/Simple-Harmonic-Motion","Concepts/Science/Physics/Waves/SHM/Simple-Pendulum","Small-Angle-Approximation","Concepts/Math/Differential-Equations/Differential-Equations","Textbooks/Physics/Physics-for-Scientists-and-Engineers/Physics-for-Scientists--and--Engineers-with-Modern-Physics"],"tags":["science/physics"],"content":"Topic: Simple Harmonic Motion\nPhysical Pendulum\nA physical pendulum is a pendulum where the mass is distributed, not concentrated at the end as with a ball on string (Simple Pendulum).
